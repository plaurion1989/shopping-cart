# shopping-cart
Instructions
This is a pair programming lab. One person from the pair will fork the lab repo which will contain all of the files necessary to complete the project. Add the other person as a collborator. That means that both of you will have privileges to push and merge to that repo.

Fill in the necessary code in the JavaScript and CSS files, but do not modify the HTML files in any way.

Your index.html is an order form for customers: it will have an order form for BusMall that contains the following features:

A dropdown menu of all BusMall products (<select> and <option> will be needed).
An input of type="number" to indicate the quantity to purchase.
An “Add to Cart” button to submit the order. When the order is submitted, all of the input fields should be cleared.
An animated confirmation message using CSS and JS, displayed when the order is submitted, plus a link to the shopping cart page.
Appropriate instructions and styling on the page.
Your cart.html page will display the BusMall orders on a typical shopping cart checkout page.

It should display all items currently in the order with a picture of the item.
Each order should have a button “Delete this item” that will remove that order from the DOM (and array of ordered items) when it is clicked.
Text inputs for name, street, city, state, ZIP code, and phone number.
An input of type="number" to enter a 16-digit credit card number.
A “Process Order” button to submit the order. When the order is submitted, all of the input fields should be cleared.
An animated confirmation message using CSS and JS.
Hints: Here’s some things to think about as you go plan out the lab for today:

You’ll need to use local storage to share data between the two HTML pages.
The constructor from BusMall might be handy as a way to organize your products.
You and your partner should plan out how you want to collaboratively attack the problem with regards to pair programming. It’s up to you how the details are managed, but make sure each partner makes contributions in both CSS and JS files.
Deploy the repo so you can see how it looks in production as you work on it.
